### My Process
We started this project by adding the HTML, then the CSS for the form. We used mainly flexbox to achieve this. We divided the tasks aongst us and since the page has three sections, each of us took one section each.

### Built With
HTML5 Markup
CSS Styling

### What I Learnt
This project taught us valuable lessons in front-end development, user experience design. Through extensive research, we learnt more about version control and project management, as well as branches and git merge. We also gained insights into continuous learning, and basic flexbox usage, ultimately enhancing our technical skills and understanding on how to work with other projects.
